# Basic Calculator
 This is a simple calculator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator provides basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
 ## Features
 - Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Exponentiation
- Handling parentheses
- Clear functionality
- Responsive design
 ## Usage
 1. Open the  `index.html`  file in any modern browser.
2. To perform calculations, click on the buttons provided on the calculator interface. The calculator supports:
   - Basic arithmetic operations by using the  `+` ,  `-` ,  `*` , and  `/`  buttons
   - Exponentiation by using the  `^`  button
   - Parentheses by using the  `(`  and  `)`  buttons
   - Decimal numbers by using the  `.`  button
3. Click the  `C`  button to clear the display.
4. Click the  `=`  button to calculate the result.
 ## Dependencies
 The calculator uses the Math.js library (version 9.0.0) to evaluate mathematical expressions: https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjs/9.0.0/math.min.js
 ## Notes
 - The calculator uses the  `**`  operator internally for exponentiation while displaying  `^`  on the display for user readability.
- The calculator does not support keyboard input at the moment. Only button clicks are allowed for input.
 ## Future Improvements
 - Add keyboard input support for a better user experience.
- Add support for more advanced mathematical functions, such as trigonometric and logarithmic functions.
- Improve error handling for invalid expressions.
- Add memory functions (MC, MR, M+, M-) for more advanced calculations.
